# Arcade mines game ðŸ’£ðŸ’¥

## Modern mines casino style game

> Built just for fun and practice, but honestly... cleaner than many real online casino versions ðŸ¤«

## About

This project was made to challenge myself in making something different and fun, while also mainly to **practice my coding skills**. My main focus in making this project was following best practices and "clean code" principles - making the code easy to read and understand, at the same time scalable and simple to extend with new features, while not making it too overcomplicated. I chose this project just because I never understood why many real online casinos have such poor implementations of this game when it always seemed so easy to build.

## Installation

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kamilMrox/Mines_Game.git
cd Mines_Game

npm install

npm run dev
```

## Usage

**Choose the number of bombs, press Play, and reveal the tiles until you reach desired multiplier and cashout(win) or hit a mine(lose)**
